1. git add # we can add files individually or all at once with air add . (current directory)
2. change text — nano readme.md (ctr + s   —>  Ctr + x)
3. git commit + adding the message directly or git commit -m “text”
4. git log # view repository commit history or git log —oneline   or   git log —stat 
5. git dif # show changes we have made and we haven’t committed yet
6. we can create new branches to test variations. git branch 
7. once the changes are clear we can merge them with - git merg (previosly we can to commit the changes) 
8. Finally we can delete de old branch with git branch -d [x]
