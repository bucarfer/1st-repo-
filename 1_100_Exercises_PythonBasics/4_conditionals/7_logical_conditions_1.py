'''Predict the output of the following code:

if False or True:
    print('Yes!')
else:
    print('No...')'''

if False or True:
    print('Yes!')
else:
    print('No...')

# the condition of using the logical operator 'or' evaluates to a truthy value if either of the operators is truthy, True will always be truthy, therefre the condition evaluates as truthy and the output will always be 'Yes!'
