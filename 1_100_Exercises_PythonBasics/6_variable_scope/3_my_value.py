'''What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

def my_function():
    a = 1

    if True:
        print(a)

my_function()'''

# it will print '1', in this case the variable is initialized inside the function and then accessed inside the if statement. Therefore the print (a) statement outputs the value 1 when my_function is invoked.
