# Is there a method to reverse a string, for example turning 'hello' into 'olleh'?

# Yes, with string[::-1]

word = input ('write the word to be reversed:')
print ('Your reversed word is: ',word[::-1]

# the method before is slicing and it is not considered a built-in method, so the official answer is there is no built-in method, but there are a few ways around to get it.
