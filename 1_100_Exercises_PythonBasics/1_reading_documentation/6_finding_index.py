''' Given a list:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "peach", "watermelon"]
How would you determine the index of the fruit "cherry" in this list?
Refer to the official Python documentation on lists to assist with your answer.'''

# to determine the index we will use the index method on the list --> list.index (element)

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "peach", "watermelon"]
print(fruits.index ('cherry'))
