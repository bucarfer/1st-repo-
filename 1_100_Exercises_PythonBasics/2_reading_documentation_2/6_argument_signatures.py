'''How many arguments does the str.join method expect? What happens if you call it with fewer or more arguments?'''

# str.join returns a string which is the addition of the strings in iterable. A type error is raised if there are non-string values in the iterable, but there is no restriction on the number of strings.

# Edited answer after reviewing the solution: My mistake was confusing arguments with strings. join accepts only one argument, and must be an iterable containing strings.
